Global Displacement Risk Model,"IDMC, UNDRR, ETH Zurich",Global Coverage,"The model combines probabilistic analysis of events recorded in national loss databases (retrospective risk) with probabilistic risk estimates for low-frequency, high-impact events (prospective risk).
Prospective disaster displacement risk is expressed as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability:
Risk = Exposure x Hazard x Vulnerability
The prospective risk profile is calculated using hazard scenarios provided by a wide range of partners. These events represent all of the possible disasters that could affect a country over different return periods. For each grid cell in the exposure map, which has a resolution of between 1km x 1km in coastal areas to 5km x 5km inland, the expected impact of a hazard is calculated using vulnerability curves to determine an expected level of damage to homes and other structures based on the hazard’s intensity. Whenever the simulated damage to a home is more than 55 per cent, it is considered uninhabitable and the household displaced.","Model developed in 2018 using from the 2015 Global Assessment Report (<a href=""https://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2015/en/home/ "">https://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2015/en/home/</a> )",Affected people,,"<a href=""info@idmc.ch"">info@idmc.ch</a>","<ul><li>Main publication: <a href=""https://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/global-disaster-displacement-risk-a-baseline-for-future-work"">https://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/global-disaster-displacement-risk-a-baseline-for-future-work</a></li>

OCHA-Bucky is a collection of coupled and stratified SEIR models. Since COVID-19 exhibits heavily age-dependent properties, wherein a majority of severe cases are in older individuals, SEIR models are stratified via the age demographic structure of a geographic region to obtain accurate estimates of case severity and deaths. Additionally, to model the spatial dynamics of COVID spread, we consider a set of SEIR sub-models at the smallest geographic level for which we have appropriate data.
